# Automation Expo – Photos

This folder contains photos captured at the Automation Expo (Mumbai, Summer 2025).

The images include:
- Industrial robotic arms performing pick-and-place tasks
- Autonomous mobile robots used for material handling
- Drone systems designed for warehouse inspection and inventory tracking

These photos document real-world robotic systems operating at scale and provide context for my interest in robot perception, planning, and manipulation.
