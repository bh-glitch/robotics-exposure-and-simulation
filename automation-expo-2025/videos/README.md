## 1. Autonomous Load-Carrying Mobile Robot

**File:** autonomous-load-carrier.mp4

This video shows an autonomous mobile robot designed to carry industrial payloads of up to **300 kg**.  
During the demonstration, the robot was assigned a predefined road-like track and autonomously followed the route without manual control.

I was permitted to ride the robot (approximately **60 kg load**), allowing direct observation of:
- Stability under dynamic human load
- Smooth velocity and acceleration control
- Reliable path-following behavior
- Safety-focused motion planning

This demonstration highlighted how perception, planning, and control systems must work together to ensure stability and safety in real-world deployment.

## 2. Self-Stabilizing Robot Under External Disturbance

**File:** self-stabilizing-robot.mp4

This video demonstrates a robot designed to recover its upright position after being pushed or knocked down.

Key observations:
- Rapid recovery using feedback-driven control
- Robust balance and posture correction
- Repeatable performance under repeated disturbances

The system illustrates how robotic intelligence extends beyond task execution to include **failure recovery and physical robustness**, which are critical in real environments.

## Relevance to Robotics Research

These videos represent practical, real-world examples of:
- Autonomous navigation
- Stability under load
- Disturbance recovery
- Feedback-based control systems

They strongly motivated my interest in robot learning, perception, and planning, particularly in unstructured or dynamic environments.
