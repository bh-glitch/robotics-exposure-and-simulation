# Robot Learning, Perception & Manipulation – Exploration Project

This repository documents my hands-on exploration of robot manipulation, perception, and motion planning using physics-based simulation.

The goal of this project was **not** to build a perfect robotic system, but to understand how robots:
- Represent the world using coordinates and orientations
- Convert desired end-effector positions into joint motions
- Behave when control, physics, and timing are imperfect

Much of the learning came from observing instability, oscillation, and unexpected behavior — phenomena that are common in real robotic systems.
